Got it! Since your Resume Screening App uses machine learning and NLP for the model and Flask for web development, here's an updated `README.md` template with these details:

# Resume Screening App

A **Resume Screening App** that uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the process of screening resumes. This app streamlines the hiring process by identifying and ranking candidates based on relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. The web interface is built with Flask.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-Powered Resume Screening**: Uses an NLP model to extract relevant information from resumes, such as skills, experience, and education.
- **Keyword Matching**: Compares resumes with job descriptions based on keywords and ranks candidates accordingly.
- **Custom Scoring Criteria**: Adjust the screening criteria (e.g., years of experience, specific skills) to fit different job roles.
- **File Upload**: Supports resume uploads in various formats like PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
- **Admin Dashboard**: View and manage screened resumes, ranked by relevance to job requirements.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - NLP Libraries: `spaCy`, `NLTK`
  - Machine Learning Framework: `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`
  - Model Types: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or a custom-built classifier for resume screening
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Flask templates)
- **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL (optional for storing resumes and results)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-screening-app.git
    cd resume-screening-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file to store any required environment variables like secret keys or database URIs.
   ```env
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Train the machine learning model**:
    Train your NLP model using the provided dataset or your own resumes.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

5. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6. **Navigate to** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the app.

## Usage

1. **Upload Resumes**: Upload resumes in PDF or DOCX format.
2. **Run Screening**: The model will analyze the resumes, extract relevant information, and rank candidates based on matching criteria.
3. **View Results**: Check the dashboard for ranked resumes and detailed reports.

## Model Training

- **Data**: Use a dataset of resumes and job descriptions to train the model.
- **Preprocessing**: The resumes are parsed using NLP tools like `spaCy` or `NLTK` to extract features such as skills, job titles, and education.
- **Model**: Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on these features to rank resumes based on job descriptions.

### Example of Feature Extraction:

- **Skills Matching**: Identify and compare the skills listed in the resume against job requirements.
- **Experience Calculation**: Parse job history and calculate years of experience.
- **Education Matching**: Compare degrees and certifications against job criteria.

## API Endpoints

- **POST** `/upload`: Upload a resume to be screened.
- **GET** `/results`: Get a list of screened resumes with relevance scores.
- **POST** `/train`: Trigger training of the model using new data (optional).
